# Dotfiles

Personal Backup of manjaro config files

Always clone bare to "~/dotfiles.git" or things will break.
And add worktree main

```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PandeCode/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Terminal Emulator

    - st (https://github.com/PandeCode/st-flexipatch)
    - kitty

## Display Server Server

    - Xorg

    Plan to use Wayland down the line. (dwl, waymonad)

## Login Manager

    - SDDM

## Desktop Environments

    - DWM (https://github.com/PandeCode/dwm-flexipatch)
    - Xmonad
    - i3



## Goals

    - Turn into personal distro based on pure arch/artix (might take a while)
    - Use init system other than systemd (openrc, runit, s6, suite66)
    - Streamline install and setup process
    - Bootable USB Flash
